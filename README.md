# Installation instructions

__Windows users__ can simply download the respective Setup file with `.exe` extension, e.g. `ShortMagic-0.1.0-setup.exe`. The installer will download and install necessary files automatically.

__Mac OS users__ should download the file with the `.dmg` extension, e.g. `ShortMagic-0.1.0.dmg`. Open it and follow any on-screen instructions. It should work with both Apple Sillicon and Intel processors.

__If your mac throws any security warnings, here's what you should do:__
- Go to `Settings -> Privacy & Security`
- Scroll down to Security section and press *Allow* on any warnings regarding ShortMagic/Whisper/FFprobe/FFmpeg apps. 

The above may occur the first time you use the application and will work without warnings the next time you use the app.

# Usage instructions

Simply click "Browse" to select or drag-drop an MP4 video file - it will be transcribed automatically. Note that AI models (~1.5GB) need to be downloaded the first time the transcription is run, it will happen automatically, please be patient.

After making any edits to the transcription - click "Export" and your captions will be encoded and you can find the resulting video on your desktop. Feel free to upload the video to Instagram Reels/TikTok/YouTube Shorts or Facebook/Twitter feeds.

Recommended video length is under 5 minutes. Although it may work with longer videos, the primary use case is to add captions to shortform videos.

# Vision

I'm building the app one problem at a time. The first problem I'm tackling is captions - because it should be possible to create engaging captions in minutes without spending hours cutting text word-by-word or hiring an editor.

In the future, the goal is to create a one-stop-shop for creating engaging shortform content, that handles editing, effects and repurposing with as much automation as possible.
